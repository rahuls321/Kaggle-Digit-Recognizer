Convolutional Neural Networks

CNNs have wide applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing. In this article, the example that I will take is related to Computer Vision. However, the basic concept remains the same and can be applied to any other use-case!

CNNs, like neural networks, are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives several inputs, takes a weighted sum over them, pass it through an activation function and responds with an output. The whole network has a loss function and all the tips and tricks that we developed for neural networks still apply on CNNs. Pretty straightforward, right?
